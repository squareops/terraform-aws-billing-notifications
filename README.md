# AWS Budget Forecast Notification

Configuration in this directory creates set of AWS resources which may be sufficient for a fully working stage or prod
Terraform module - creates an AWS Budget with notification via SNS enabled/Email enabled with optional sns topic
creation (or use a pre-existing one) to alert when a U$S (currency actually configurable) budget forecasted threshold % is reached
(currently 100% of the `limit_amount`).

Provides an AWS budget resource (`aws_budgets_budget`). Budgets use the cost visualisation provided by **Cost Explorer** to show
you the status of your budgets, to provide forecasts of your estimated costs, and to track your AWS usage, including your free tier usage.

Please check the **input parameters** for a better understanding of it.

## Usage Example
```hcl
module "aws_budget_alert" {
  source            = "squareops/billing-notifications/aws"
  version           = "1.0.1"
  name              = local.name
  environment       = local.environment
  account_id        = local.account_id
  budget_type       = "COST"
  limit_amount      = "10"
  limit_unit        = "USD"
  time_period_start = "2023-11-16_00:00"
  time_unit         = "DAILY"
  notification = {
    comparison_operator = "GREATER_THAN"
    threshold           = 100
    threshold_type      = "PERCENTAGE"
    notification_type   = "ACTUAL"
  }
  cost_types = {
    include_credit             = false
    include_discount           = true
    include_other_subscription = true
    include_recurring          = true
    include_refund             = false
    include_subscription       = true
    include_support            = true
    include_tax                = true
    include_upfront            = true
    use_blended                = false
  }
  slack_notification_enabled = true
  slack_channel_id           = "XXXXXZZZZ"
  slack_workspace_id         = "ABCDUTSSZ"
  email_notification_enabled = true
  email_address              = "notification.com"
}

```
## Usage

To run this example you need to execute:

```bash
$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply
```

Or if using the `Makefile` in this repo you need to execute:

```bash
$ make init
$ make plan
$ make apply
```

Note that this example may create resources which can cost money (AWS EC2, for example). Run `terraform destroy` or `make destroy`
when you don't need these resources.
